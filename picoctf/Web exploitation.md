# Cookies
**Flag:** `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_96cdadfd}`

- step 1
  When i opened the URl I noticed it was a simple webpage with a prompt. There was a visible prompt called 'snickerdoodle' So i tried that and the website changed the URl to ```http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/check```. and gave out the message **That is a cookie! Not very special though...**. So i tried another random prompt but this time the URL didn't change and instead was greated with the message ***That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie.***

- step 2
Since the name of the challenge was cookies I decided to check the cookies the website was using. So using the inspect tab, application in that cookies I noticed that whenever I type snickerdoodle the value of the cookie changed to 0 and an incorect prompt had the value to -1. This made me curious wheather there are other words which are valid so I tried various different cookie names but was unsuccesful until I tried the name gingerbread which changed the cookie value to 23. THis means there are different words for which the cookie(name) value keeps changing and maybe on of the values for cookie might give us the flag.

- step 3
  I wanted to manually enter the values so I started changing the values to random numbers but got the same output and i wanted to try until 30 vut luckily got the flag when the cookie value was changed to 18.

concepts learned through solving this challenge:
1. a Little deeper understanding about how cookies work and get stored.

Other incorrect methods I tried:
1. Tried doing the challenge using BURP suite using intercept but could'nt figure out how to use the repeater funtion so tried the manual method.
2. Also tried to use a python script using the requests but Don't get why that didn't work
