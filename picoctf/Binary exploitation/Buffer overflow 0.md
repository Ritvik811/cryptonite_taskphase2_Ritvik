# BUffer overflow0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}`

- step 1
Here we get the source code and the machine code. Initially I ran the program to see it's behaviour. It asked for an input and after entering 12 it said the porgram is exiting. So now i know the excution.

- step 2
After looking through the source code I notice the function sigsegv_handler(). This function is going to give us the flag. Looking through the code I noticed strcpy() is taking the input and storing it into ```buf2[16]``` string. the string buf2 is defined as a char with a size 16. This means I can try to override it by entering an input longer than 166 characters, this worked and gave the flag.

What I learned through solving this challenge:

1. Read through a given program carefully
2. Learnt what buffer overflowing is

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- Initially tried running the program but it wouldn't run 

References

- reference 1
- reference 2
